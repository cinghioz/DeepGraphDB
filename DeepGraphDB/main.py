    Scalable graph database using DGL for knowledge graphs and large-scale graph operations.
    
    This class combines multiple mixins to provide comprehensive graph database functionality:
    - Loading: Bulk loading of nodes and edges
    - Neighborhood: K-hop neighbor retrieval
    - Subgraph: Extraction and merging of subgraphs
    - MetaPath: Meta-path queries for heterogeneous graphs
    - Query: Efficient node and edge querying
    - Utility: Save/load, statistics, and helper methods
    
    Examples:
        >>> # Create and load a homogeneous graph
        >>> db = DeepGraphDB()
        >>> db.bulk_load_homogeneous_graph(edges_df, nodes_df)
        
        >>> # Get 2-hop neighbors
        >>> neighbors = db.get_k_hop_neighbors([1, 2, 3], k=2)
        
        >>> # Query nodes by feature
        >>> high_score_nodes = db.query_nodes_by_feature(
        ...     feature_name='score',
        ...     condition='gt',
        ...     value=0.8
